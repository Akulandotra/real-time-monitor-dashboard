This project is a real-time process monitoring dashboard built to visualize how an operating system manages and allocates system resources. It provides continuous insights into CPU usage, memory consumption, disk activity, network throughput, and currently running processes. The backend is developed using FastAPI and psutil, which collect system metrics and stream them to the frontend through a WebSocket connection. The frontend displays this data using interactive charts, dynamic UI components, and a detailed process table with search, sorting, and modal-based information. The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-time OS behavior in a clear and practical way, helping users understand how processes interact with system resources and how performance metrics change over time.
