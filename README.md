This project is a real-time system monitoring dashboard built for understanding OS behavior and performance. It visualizes live CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network throughput, and active processes through an interactive dashboard interface. A FastAPI backend continuously streams system metrics over WebSocket, while the frontend displays them using dynamic charts and an intuitive layout. The dashboard helps track how resources fluctuate in real time and provides a practical view of OS-level process managemen.
